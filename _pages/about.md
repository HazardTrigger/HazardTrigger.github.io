I am currently a research assistant in [College of Intelligence and Computing](http://cic.tju.edu.cn/), Tianjin University, under the supervision of Associate Professor [Zhibin Niu](http://cic.tju.edu.cn/info/1073/1206.htm). I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Tianjin University in Tianjin, China, where I am a member of Visual Computing Lab in College of Intelligence and Computing.


Research
======
My research interests are mainly in **data analysis**, **data visualization** and interdisciplinary, but also include **complex networks**, **machine learning**.
In fact, my work focuses on data analysis and building effective and scalable visualization applications for them, bringing theory and algorithms to applications.
